# Database Configuration
+ We are using `MySQL` as a *Database Server*
+ and we are using a database called `pblock` that have to be present on the server (your machine) - create it as you want -
+ execute the query located in `databaseService/CreateDB_Script.sql` before you start (for example using `phpMyAdmin`)
